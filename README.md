I made this batch script to display a powerpoint presentation in a continuos loop for something at work. It allows for replacement of the presentation while it's running be it from a remote location or a usb flash drive. A setting in powerpoint called "Loop contiuously" must be enabled to avoid closing and opening the presentation again after program ends.
To use it replace C:\path\to\presentation in all places and save the files with a .cmd extension, then run them. A more elegant solution would be to assign that path to a variable and change it in one place but this works and i've used it only once. If then need to deploy this on multiple pc's should arise then i will modify it.
